                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Founded in 2024 by visionary minds Tanishq and Shubham, Adhyant Construction began as a small local builder with a big dream—to redefine the landscape of civil engineering and construction with integrity, innovation, and purpose.</p>
                    <p>With a passion for creating spaces that are both functional and timeless, the duo laid the foundation of a company rooted in quality, reliability, and forward-thinking design. What started as a modest operation has now grown into a respected name in the industry, known for delivering projects that consistently exceed expectations.</p>
                    <p>At the heart of Adhyant Construction is a team that blends technical expertise with creative vision. Under the leadership of Tanishq and Shubham, we have taken on diverse projects—ranging from residential to commercial spaces—always with a commitment to safety, sustainability, and excellence.</p>
                    <p>Every structure we build is a reflection of our belief that great construction is not just about materials and machines, but about people, purpose, and passion. With every brick laid, we aim to build lasting value—for our clients, our communities, and the future.</p>
                    <p>Join us on this journey of building beyond boundaries—with Adhyant Construction, where vision meets craftsmanship.</p>
